## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
hello my name is aprilia rianawati usually called April or Apeng. Undergraduate Gophysics Student at Universitas Gadjah Mada. I'm currently learning computing methods using vscode, git hub and also git. I really like plants but I'm majoring in geophysics. The two semesters that I have lived in geophysics have made me interested in earth things because I think earth applies several other sciences such as physics, chemistry and mathematics.

âš¡ Fun fact:  don't like jam and eat sugary drinks
âš¡ Hobby : cooking
